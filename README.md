## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I learned how to have using the grid sections in bootstrap to have 2 rows in desktop and 3 rows in smartphone/tablet sizes.

### Continued development

The shift between desktop and tablet size is abrupt. If I were to continue this challenge, I would focus on that shift to make it more natural. Though since most people do not actively change their display size while viewing their website (besides rotating their screens on mobile) it might not be too much on a concern(?)

## Acknowledgments

The bootstrap website has really good documentation on how to use their grid models. Also, thanks to frontendmentor.io for providing these challenges for beginners like myself to test my ability.
